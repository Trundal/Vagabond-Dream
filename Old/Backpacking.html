        <p>Backpacking Executive? Wha..? <br>
          17 Nov, 2012</p>
        <p>Growing up in the wilds of Alaska, I thought I knew what Backpacking was all about. Simply cram everything needed for survival into a rucksack, then cheerfully disappear into the vast, untouched wilderness for days or weeks at a time. Hike for miles. Setup camp. Go fishing. Dodge bears. Experience life at it’s most bliss.</p>
        <p>Upon leaving my wintery wonderland (or frigid icy hell, you choose), I was perplexed by the usage of the term "Backpacking" as spoken by the more densely populated Southern cultures. There’s no actual need to hike, just take the bus. Pitching a tent in a hostel lobby seems impractical. The fish can be found lazily resting on beds of ice at the supermarket. "Bears" are simply boys (and girls) who’ve gone too long without a shave. The only semblance to true "Backpacking" from my perspective were the vastly overstuffed bags people strap to themselves as they struggle to "get away from it all" by taking everything with them. So that’s it? Backpacking is just any type of extended travel that involves this one particular form of baggage? By that logic, I’m not taking an "Extended Business Trip," I’m actually "Luggaging." I'm starting to get a feel for this "civilisation" thing, I think.</p>
        <p>OK fine, but what does that have to do with being an Executive? </p>
        <p>Back in my first attempt at Post Secondary Eduction, I was strongly encouraged by my academic advisor to take some time away from my Theatre studies to engage in something she called "useful," like Economics. I was clearly on the cusp of becoming an obscenely rich and famous actor, so perhaps some minor dabbling in mundane money management could be a worthwhile diversion after all. It turns out I had a head for business and was invited to join the Business College. Of course, an artistic genius such as myself has no time for Statistics Courses and learning Office Productivity Software. Naturally, I politely refused their well-intended offer. That fateful decision triggered a chain of events that would inevitably lead to my lavish (don't I wish), jet-setting career as an integral member of the Senior Management Team of a multi-million dollar, multi-national corporation.</p>
        <p>Impressive, yeah? Sure, I had a fancy title, but in most respects the reality is far more ordinary than one might imagine. Despite being high on the Org Chart, senior management is not vastly different than any other office job - just with more stress and less leisure time. Suddenly you're resposnisble for, well, everything and everyone under your remit.  When things work well, nobody notices. But when they don't... That's where passion makes all the difference. If you love what you do, the stress doesn't get to you, the line between personal and professional blurs and the money ceases to matter (much). If you don't love what you're doing, however, no amount of money can compensate.        </p>
        <p>The point I’m making is this (yes, there is a point); if you’re looking for a place to observe the  travails of a wandering soul who, refusing to 'grow up', stuffed his favourite toys into a bag and ran away from home to pursue his dreams...</p>
        <p>Welcome. :)</p>
