<h2>Welcome to Vagabond Dream! (from the 1990s)</h2>

<p>Welcome to the reconstruction project. Yes, the site is quite primitive at the moment, but I prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new journey. We are changing focus (or pulling focus, for you camera guys) from being predominantly media-centric and are transitioning towards Web and iOS development. No worries, the cameras and lights and microphones are all still well loved and cared for, but they will now serve a supporting role.</p>

<p>Please join us in our redesign and rebirth. Whenever there’s a design update, a link to the previous iterations will allow you to track our progress. This is merely the starting point. </p>

<p>Warmest Wishes,<br/>
Korey Powell<br/>
Vagabond Dream - Managing Director</p>

<h4>Current Progress:</h4>

<p><strong>11 Nov, 2014 - [Developer Comments]</strong></p>

<p>Here's a quick update from the last log:

<ul>
<li>Created a new GIT repository for some iOS development & training (Note: Add link to GIT repositories [Done])</li>
<li>Rebuilt my image database - lengthy & long overdue project (Note: Add Photo/Video Gallary to site)</li>
<li>Switched to CODA as my web development tool (Option: Do a review of CODA)
<li>Added some old projects for reference. So old... 
</ul>

I have been busy and I've been generating ideas for the site. On one hand this is good as I'm fleshing out what exactly I want to achieve with this site, which will also help me settle on a functional design. On the other hand it risks devolving into 'feature creep' where nothing will ever get finished.</p>

<p>So, to bring a bit of order to the list of wishes, I need to make a list of 'Needs' and 'Nice to Haves' - as well as some sort of development plan to roll this out. My goal is to show the progression as I go, sort of like making my office in a construction site. It'll be messy, but in the end it might be interesting to see all of the iterative steps along the way. Therefore, I also need to make an easy way to navigate through my version control.</p>

<p><strong>30 Oct, 2014 - [Developer Comments]</strong></p>

<p>I’ve enrolled in a few online courses through Stack Social to brush up my coding and UX design skills. I did study computer science way back at the turn of the century, but much of what I learned back then remains useful today. For example, the legacy of C programming remains strong, so sitting in C, C++, Java programming courses remain relevant, MVC software architecture is still at the heart of new technologies, such as iOS development. classes/pointers/instantiation/inheritance/arrays/etc… all still there. What is new, however, is Apple’s Swift programming language. It was released just this year, so now is a good time to get back into development and start with a fresh new language. </p>

<p>In that spirit, I’ve signed up for some online iOS development courses through Bitfountain.io. They were sold at huge discounts through Stack Social, which is a great resource for developers looking for useful courses and gear. [NOTE: Make ‘Developer Reviews’ section. Do reviews for Stack Social, Bitfountain, Sketch, Hype…] I also picked up a few affordable HTML/CSS/JS courses for reference to help me build this site. Back in my day, all we had was HTML 2 and CSS was merely some promising new technology that nobody understood. I’ve got a few things to learn on that front, as well.</p>
