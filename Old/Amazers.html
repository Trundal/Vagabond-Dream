            <p>I'm pleased to present to you with the articles you requested. I spent a fair amount of time trying to find the appropriate feel for these articles. In the end, I settled on something between "Informative" and "Inspirational" in content, and leaning towards "Informal Op/Ed" in tone. I'm sure the exact formula will evolve over time, but hopefully you enjoy reading these as much I enjoyed writing them.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Bayane A. Saada: “I am Just a Girl”</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">12 December, 2014 by <a href="mailto:korey@vagabonddream.com">Korey Powell</a></p>
            
            <p>Here at Amazers, our passion is to improve the world through community engagement and mutual support. We are continuously encouraged by the enthusiasm shown by the challenge participants and by the inspirational reports that have been written in the message boards. </p>
                       
            <p>There was one standout thread in particular that caught our attention; not just from the content of the original post, but also from the quality of comments in the resulting thread. In late September 2014, <a href="http://www.amazers.co/users/bayane">Bayane A. Saada</a> clearly expressed the heartbreaking reality that the ability to live one’s life freely is severely restricted for millions of girls and women throughout the world. In her words:</p>
            
            <p class="blog-post-quote">“I really want to be an independent young woman who can lead the life she feels happy to live. But it’s not easy to do so for a “girl”. I hate to say that but if I were a boy I could easily accomplish all I ever want in life, or at least have a bigger chance.</p>
            
            <p class="blog-post-quote">In my society, the wings of a lot girls are being cut.” - <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/3400">Bayane A. Saada</a></p>
            
            <p>For myself, being both male and a product of Western upbringing, it is completely impossible for me to truly understand the gravity and frustration behind these words. At best, I can gain an academic awareness of the situation. A simple web search produces tragic accounts that are as widespread as they are horrifying. </p>

			<p>Take, for example, the 2014 <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-02/boko-haram-leader-claims-kidnapped-girls-have-been-married-off/5860332">kidnapping of over 200 schoolgirls</a> from Chibok, Nigeria by Boko Haram, an organisation who’s name literally means, “Western Education is Forbidden.” Then there’s the 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai">assassination attempt of Malala Yousafzai</a>, who was targeted for being a 15 year-old Pakistani girl, attending school in the Swat Valley, and blogging about it. There’s also the shocking 2006 <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/14/germany.mainsection">murder of Hatun Surucu</a>, 23, who was shot to death by her younger brother at a bus stop in Berlin, Germany. She was killed for the 'dishonourable' act of living independently from her family.</p>

			<p class="blog-post-quote">“This young woman, who loved life, was a victim because she lived life as she saw fit, and that's why she was shot by her brother right here among us.” - Judge Michael Degreif, Berlin State Court</p>

			<p>These events highlight precisely the extraordinary nature of Bayane’s story. Although her native Lebanon is significantly more stable and moderate than most other countries in the region, it still does not afford women the freedoms that those of us in the West take for granted. Yet, in spite of the risks and limitations, she not only pursues her dreams, she dares to dream big; most recently <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/376">launching a fundraiser</a> to finance the construction of a school in Kenya.</p> 

			<p>We applaud her openness and bravery, and we are extremely pleased by the outpouring of support from the community. This is humanity at it’s best, and this is what Amazers is all about. Thank you all.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Daring to Connect - Skype Challenge #1</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">12 December, 2014 by <a href="mailto:korey@vagabonddream.com">Korey Powell</a></p>
            
            <p>As “The Year of the Horse” races to a swift end, the Amazers team launched the Skype mini-challenge to the community. The concept was simple: </p>
            <ol>
            	<li>Sign up to receive a chat partner</li>
            	<li>Hold a Skype conversation</li>
            	<li>Post a report on the message boards</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>By the end of the challenge, there were 233 participants and 57 completed submissions. We couldn’t be happier with the results. As usual, the community exceeded all expectations. </p>
            
            <p class="blog-post-quote">“It was absolutely a fantastic Monday evening hangout. We went back in time, we stopped in time, we went ahead of time and it was all fun.” - <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/4051">Dipanjan Mitra</a></p>
            
            <p>Many of the participants were Skype veterans who jumped in and started chatting without giving it a second thought. But there were also many for whom this wasn’t such a common occurrence, so we give special acknowledgement to those of you who set aside your apprehensions and gave this a try. Gauging from the reports, it’s clear that any initial discomfort was well rewarded.</p>

			<p class="blog-post-quote">“Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh! That was exciting! … I wasn't sure if I wanted to do it in the beginning but now I'm glad that I did it. This challenge for me was about stepping out of my comfort zone and I feel I did that.” - <a href="http://www.amazers.co/users/kherdejsia-thomas-llewellyn">Kherdejsia Thomas-llewellyn</a></p>

			<p>Then, as the message board began filling with reports from the community, we were reading again and again how randomly paired individuals had so much in common - sometimes freakishly so. There is clearly something magical about leaving matters to chance.</p>

			<p class="blog-post-quote">“… What synchronicity matched to him. We have so many common interests and it was so easy to talk and talk and talk. We will [be] keeping in touch for sure.” - <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/4094">Denise Mortimer</a></p>

			<p class="blog-post-quote">“I just had the Skype call and I'm still smiling and happy. … The time flew and it's amazing how much common things two randomly matched people can have.” - <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/4081">Marta Ķīvīte</a></p>

			<p>It’s amazing how quickly interpersonal walls can be brought down and genuine trust can be built. There were many instances of this special bond developing over great distances in a remarkably short time. The frequency by which this was happening with complete strangers from different cultures is truly life affirming.</p> 

			<p class="blog-post-quote">“What struck me the most was her genuine openness and willingness to listen and give a truthful advice. She reminded me once again how beautiful life can be and that you need to take chances and believe in yourself wholeheartedly!” - <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/4055">Gabriele Gimbutaite</a></p>

			<p>Thank you all for your participation. I know many of you have also connected on various social media outlets, and we absolutely encourage you to get together often. We are all about community and we couldn’t have asked for more amazing people.</p> 

<p>And to our challenge winners, <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/4021">Ilija</a>, <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/4005">Sai</a>, <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/4016">Kia</a> & <a href="http://www.amazers.co/posts/4025">Romain</a>… Well done! Enjoy your Amazers T-Shirts and stickers!</p>
