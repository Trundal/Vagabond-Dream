        <h4>Hand-Crafted & Responsive</h4>
        <p>Greenwave had approached us to create a responsive website to highlight their software utility concept that they would be submitting for a funding competition. Of course, as with any startup, the budget was quite constrained and the turnaround was short to meet the submission deadline.</p>
        <p>After several pots of coffee and a few late-nighters, we made the deadline. The Greenwave team received some initial funding to continue their project and will be moving forward to the next stage later this year. Wish them luck!</p>
